[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

A Collection manager.

## Install
Use NPM to install with the command:

```
npm i -S shushujs
```

## How to use
Import ShushuJS inside your JS file using:

```javascript
var shushujs = require('shushujs');
```

Create your Collection passing the schema (must be an SukimaJS schema):

```javascript
var Users = shushujs(schema);
```

Listen the 'new' event:

```javascript
Users.on('new', function (err, evt) {
  if (err) throw err;
  // do something
});
```

Add new data:

```
Users.set({
  name: 'sergiodxa',
  email: 'sergio@xalambri.com.ar'
});
```

If you want to use it in browser just compile it using Browserify to create a browser compatible JS file.

Enjoy!
